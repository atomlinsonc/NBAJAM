## Features

- üìä **Accuracy Scoring** - Calculates prediction accuracy for each player

## How Scoring Works

Each player's prediction accuracy is calculated based on how close their predicted seed is to the actual current seed:

- If a team is predicted at seed 7 and is currently at seed 10, that's 3 seeds off
- Accuracy = (14 - distance) / 14 * 100%
- In this example: (14 - 3) / 14 = 78.6% accuracy for that team
- Overall score is the average accuracy across all 30 teams

## Customization

### Adding/Removing Players

Edit `predictions.js` to add or remove players. Make sure each player has both `eastern` and `western` arrays with exactly 15 teams each.

### Changing Color Thresholds

Edit the `getAccuracyClass()` function in `app.js`:

```javascript
function getAccuracyClass(accuracy) {
    if (accuracy >= 90) return 'accuracy-excellent';  // Green
    if (accuracy >= 80) return 'accuracy-good';       // Light Green
    if (accuracy >= 70) return 'accuracy-fair';       // Yellow
    if (accuracy >= 60) return 'accuracy-poor';       // Orange
    return 'accuracy-bad';                             // Red
}
```

### Changing Update Frequency

In `app.js`, modify the refresh interval (currently 5 minutes):

```javascript
setInterval(fetchNBAStandings, 5 * 60 * 1000); // Change 5 to desired minutes
```

## API Information

### Team Names Not Matching
- Ensure team names in `predictions.js` match exactly with those in `team-logos.js`

- Check that all files are committed and pushed
